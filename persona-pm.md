# Target Persona: The Growth-Stage PM

## Demographics & Role

**Name Archetype:** Jordan Lee / Taylor Kim
**Title:** Product Manager
**Company Stage:** Series B SaaS (20-100 employees, $5M-$20M ARR)
**Experience Level:** 3-5 years in product management
**Reports To:** VP Product or Head of Product
**Team Size:** Solo PM or part of a 2-3 person PM team

## Day-to-Day Responsibilities

- Own product roadmap and sprint planning for 1-2 product areas
- Write technical specs and user stories for engineering
- Work with engineering daily on feasibility and implementation details
- Prioritize features based on customer feedback and technical constraints
- Run sprint planning, standups, and retrospectives
- Validate prototypes and review code changes before release

## Technical Background

**Current AI Usage:**
- Uses ChatGPT daily for drafting specs, brainstorming solutions, and synthesizing feedback
- Comfortable with prompting and iteration
- Sees AI as a productivity tool, not a replacement

**Coding Experience:**
- Can read code but doesn't write production code daily
- Familiar with basic SQL, JavaScript, and API concepts
- Has used GitHub to review PRs but doesn't commit code regularly
- Comfortable with terminal basics but not a power user

**Relationship with Engineering:**
- Works closely with engineers every day
- Often asks "can we build this?" or "how much effort would this take?"
- Feels pressure to understand technical details to make good prioritization decisions
- Wishes they could validate feasibility independently without interrupting engineers mid-sprint

## Current Pain Points

### 1. Technical Validation Gap
"I need to understand technical feasibility before committing features to a sprint, but I don't want to interrupt engineering for every question."

### 2. Estimation Uncertainty
"I'm responsible for roadmap planning, but I can't accurately estimate effort without understanding how our system works. This leads to surprises and missed deadlines."

### 3. Spec Writing Bottleneck
"Writing detailed technical specs takes forever because I'm constantly checking if my assumptions about the implementation are correct."

### 4. Implementation Surprises
"By the time engineering starts building a feature, we discover technical constraints I didn't know about. This causes scope creep and delays."

## Goals & Metrics

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Feature velocity** – Ship features faster with fewer surprises and rework
2. **Accurate estimation** – Improve sprint planning with better technical context
3. **Engineering collaboration** – Reduce interruptions and improve async communication
4. **Informed prioritization** – Make roadmap decisions based on true technical cost

**Success Metrics:**
- Sprint completion rate (% of committed work finished)
- Estimation accuracy (actual vs. estimated effort)
- Time-to-ship for features
- Engineering satisfaction with PM collaboration
- Number of "surprise" scope changes mid-sprint

## Objections & Skepticism About AI Coding Tools

### "This isn't for me—I'm not an engineer"
**Core belief:** AI coding tools are for developers who write code all day. Since I don't code professionally, I assume these tools aren't relevant to my job.

**Why they're wrong (but don't know it yet):** Claude Code doesn't require you to write code. It reads codebases and answers questions in plain English. It's more like having an on-demand engineer who never gets annoyed by your questions.

### "I already use ChatGPT—what's different?"
**Core belief:** ChatGPT handles my spec writing and brainstorming needs. Another AI tool feels redundant.

**Why they're wrong:** ChatGPT can't read your company's codebase, understand how your product actually works, or explain technical details with source-level accuracy. Claude Code can.

### "I don't have time to learn a new tool"
**Core belief:** Learning developer tools (terminal, GitHub, etc.) has a steep learning curve. I'm already stretched thin managing sprints and stakeholders.

**Why they're wrong:** Claude Code works in natural language. The only "learning" is typing questions. If you can use ChatGPT, you can use Claude Code.

### "This will make me look less technical to my team"
**Core belief:** Asking an AI for help instead of figuring it out myself might signal that I'm not technical enough for this role.

**Why they're wrong:** The best PMs are resourceful, not omniscient. Using Claude Code to get answers faster makes you more effective, not less credible. Engineers will appreciate fewer interruptions during deep work.

## Buying Process

### Awareness Stage
- Discovers Claude Code through LinkedIn, a PM Slack group, or a tweet from a peer
- Initial reaction: "Wait, can this really help me understand our codebase without bothering engineering?"
- Clicks through to landing page to learn more

### Evaluation Stage
- Watches a demo or reads a use case for non-technical roles
- Key question: "Can I use this without installing a bunch of developer tools?"
- Looks for proof that other PMs use it successfully

### Decision Stage
- Signs up for free trial (low friction, no credit card required)
- Tests it on a real task: "How does our authentication work?" or "What's the effort to add OAuth support?"
- Decision criteria: Did this save me time? Was the output accurate? Would I use this again?

### Adoption Stage
- Integrates Claude Code into daily workflows: sprint planning, technical validation, spec writing
- Shares results with engineering ("I used Claude Code to validate feasibility before adding this to the sprint")
- Becomes an internal champion

## Marketing Implications

### Messaging Priorities
1. **Relevance for non-engineers** – Lead with "validate feasibility in seconds" and "ask questions in plain English"
2. **Time savings** – Emphasize speed and self-service over technical depth
3. **Better decisions** – Address the fear of committing to features without understanding technical constraints
4. **Social proof** – Show other PMs and non-technical roles using it successfully

### Content Needs
- Use cases: "How PMs use Claude Code to ship faster"
- Tutorial: "Your first 5 questions to ask Claude Code"
- Comparison: "Claude Code vs. ChatGPT for product managers"
- ROI calculator: "How much estimation accuracy could you gain?"

### Channels
- LinkedIn (primary): Organic posts, testimonials, carousel explainers
- Product management communities: Slack groups, Mind the Product, Product School
- Product management tools: Partnerships with Linear, Jira, Productboard
- Engineering-adjacent content: Dev blogs that PMs read (e.g., Increment, Stack Overflow blog)

## Success Scenario (12 Months Post-Adoption)

Jordan is now the most technically informed PM on the team. They use Claude Code to:
- Validate feasibility independently (saving 5+ hours/week of engineering time)
- Write accurate technical specs in 30 minutes instead of 3 hours
- Estimate effort more accurately by understanding implementation details upfront
- Review code changes and prototypes without waiting for an engineer to explain them

Their sprints now have a 95% completion rate (up from 70%) because there are fewer mid-sprint surprises. Engineering loves working with them because they arrive at planning with realistic, well-researched proposals. The VP of Product has noticed their velocity improvement and asked them to mentor other PMs on technical collaboration.

Their LinkedIn bio now reads: "PM who ships like an engineer (without being one)."
