# Webflow User Persona: Sarah Chen - Design-to-Dev Translator

## Overview
**Name:** Sarah Chen
**Age:** 29
**Role:** Senior Product Designer at a Series B SaaS startup
**Location:** Austin, TX
**Experience:** 6 years in product design, 2 years using Webflow

## Background
Sarah transitioned from graphic design to product design after realizing she wanted more control over the final implementation of her work. She's fluent in Figma and has basic HTML/CSS knowledge, but doesn't consider herself a developer. She's responsible for designing and shipping marketing pages, landing pages, and customer-facing web experiences at her company.

## Goals
- **Ship faster:** Reduce dependency on engineering team for marketing site updates
- **Maintain quality:** Ensure designs are pixel-perfect and responsive across devices
- **Scale workflows:** Build reusable components and design systems
- **Prove impact:** Track performance of pages she builds and optimize based on data
- **Career growth:** Expand skillset to be more technical without becoming a full developer

## Pain Points
- **Engineering bottleneck:** Marketing site updates take 2-3 weeks when routed through dev team
- **Design-dev handoff:** Designs get compromised during implementation
- **Tool fragmentation:** Uses Figma for design, Jira for tickets, Google Docs for specs
- **Limited technical depth:** Struggles with custom interactions and complex logic
- **Performance anxiety:** Worries about SEO, load times, and technical best practices

## Behaviors & Preferences
- **Daily tools:** Figma, Webflow, Slack, Linear, Google Analytics
- **Learning style:** Learns by doing; prefers video tutorials and templates over documentation
- **Decision process:** Reads reviews, watches YouTube tutorials, tries free tier before buying
- **Content consumption:** Follows design Twitter, watches conference talks, reads UX blogs
- **Work hours:** 9am-6pm, occasional evening work during launch weeks

## Technical Profile
- **Design skills:** Expert (Figma, Sketch, Adobe Suite)
- **HTML/CSS:** Intermediate (can read and modify, doesn't write from scratch)
- **JavaScript:** Beginner (can copy/paste and tweak code snippets)
- **CMS experience:** WordPress, Contentful, basic understanding of APIs
- **Webflow proficiency:** Advanced user, knows interactions, CMS, and most features

## Use Cases for Webflow
1. **Marketing site redesign:** Complete rebuild of company homepage and product pages
2. **Landing page experiments:** A/B testing different messaging and layouts
3. **Blog & resource hub:** Managing content through Webflow CMS
4. **Event microsites:** Quick turnaround sites for product launches and conferences
5. **Portfolio & case studies:** Showcasing design work with interactive prototypes

## Decision Criteria
- **Ease of use:** Can I learn this quickly without formal training?
- **Design control:** Will my designs look exactly as intended?
- **Collaboration:** Can my team review and contribute?
- **Performance:** Will sites be fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly?
- **Value:** Does this save enough time to justify the cost?

## Jobs to Be Done
When I need to **launch a new marketing page**, I want to **go from design to live site in days, not weeks**, so I can **validate messaging and iterate quickly without blocking engineering resources**.

## Success Metrics
- Time from design to deployment (target: < 3 days)
- Number of pages shipped per quarter (target: 15+)
- Page load performance (target: 90+ Lighthouse score)
- Conversion rate improvements (target: +20% lift on experiments)
- Engineering hours saved (target: 40+ hours/quarter)

## Frustrations with Current Solutions
- **Traditional web dev:** Too slow, too expensive, requires eng resources
- **Page builders (Wix, Squarespace):** Not professional enough, limited customization
- **Code-first approaches:** Steep learning curve, maintenance burden
- **Design tools only:** No path to production without handoff

## Why Webflow?
- Visual design interface that matches how she thinks
- Generates clean, semantic HTML/CSS automatically
- Built-in hosting, CMS, and interactions
- Professional output that developers respect
- Large community and marketplace for learning
- Bridges gap between design and development

## Influencers & Community
- Follows Webflow YouTubers (Ran Segall, Flux Academy)
- Active in Webflow forums and Discord
- Attends No-Code Conf and design conferences
- Shares work on Twitter and Dribbble
- Part of local Webflow meetup group
