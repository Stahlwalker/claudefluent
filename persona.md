# Target Persona: The Growth-Stage PMM

## Demographics & Role

**Name Archetype:** Sarah Chen / Alex Martinez
**Title:** Product Marketing Manager
**Company Stage:** Series B SaaS (20-100 employees, $5M-$20M ARR)
**Experience Level:** 3-5 years in product marketing
**Reports To:** VP Marketing or Head of Product Marketing
**Team Size:** Solo PMM or part of a 2-3 person PMM team

## Day-to-Day Responsibilities

- Own go-to-market strategy for 2-3 product areas
- Create competitive battlecards and sales enablement materials
- Write release notes, blog posts, and product messaging
- Support pipeline generation with content and campaigns
- Gather customer feedback and translate it into product insights
- Manage launches and coordinate cross-functional teams

## Technical Background

**Current AI Usage:**
- Uses ChatGPT daily for drafting emails, brainstorming headlines, and summarizing meeting notes
- Comfortable with prompting and iteration
- Sees AI as a productivity tool, not a replacement

**Coding Experience:**
- No formal programming background
- Can read basic HTML/CSS when working with the website team
- Familiar with APIs conceptually from reading product docs
- Has never used GitHub, VS Code, or the terminal

**Relationship with Engineering:**
- Works closely with PMs and occasionally engineers
- Often asks engineers "how does this feature work?" or "can we build this?"
- Feels intimidated by technical jargon and avoids appearing unknowledgeable
- Wishes they could answer their own technical questions without interrupting the dev team

## Current Pain Points

### 1. Technical Knowledge Gap
"I need to understand how our product works to market it effectively, but I don't want to bother engineering with basic questions during sprint planning."

### 2. Content Bottleneck
"I'm responsible for release notes, blog posts, API docs, and sales collateral—all on tight deadlines. Writing technical content takes forever because I'm constantly fact-checking with the team."

### 3. Competitive Research
"Our competitors ship fast. I need to understand what they're doing under the hood, but I can't read their codebase or API docs without help."

### 4. Slow Feedback Loops
"By the time I write a spec, get feedback from product and engineering, and revise it, two weeks have passed. I need to move faster without sacrificing accuracy."

## Goals & Metrics

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Pipeline contribution** – Generate MQLs and influence deals through content and campaigns
2. **Content velocity** – Ship more high-quality content without hiring more people
3. **Competitive intelligence** – Stay ahead of competitors with faster, deeper insights
4. **Cross-functional efficiency** – Reduce dependency on engineering and product for basic questions

**Success Metrics:**
- Marketing-sourced pipeline (% of total pipeline)
- Content output per month (blog posts, case studies, collateral)
- Time-to-ship for product launches
- Sales win rate when competitive intel is used

## Objections & Skepticism About AI Coding Tools

### "This isn't for me—I'm not an engineer"
**Core belief:** AI coding tools are for developers who write code all day. Since I don't code, I assume these tools aren't relevant to my job.

**Why they're wrong (but don't know it yet):** Claude Code doesn't require you to write code. It reads codebases and answers questions in plain English. It's more like having an on-demand engineer who never gets annoyed by your questions.

### "I already use ChatGPT—what's different?"
**Core belief:** ChatGPT handles my writing and brainstorming needs. Another AI tool feels redundant.

**Why they're wrong:** ChatGPT can't read your company's codebase, understand how your product actually works, or explain technical details with source-level accuracy. Claude Code can.

### "I don't have time to learn a new tool"
**Core belief:** Learning developer tools (terminal, GitHub, etc.) has a steep learning curve. I'm already stretched thin.

**Why they're wrong:** Claude Code works in natural language. The only "learning" is typing questions. If you can use ChatGPT, you can use Claude Code.

### "This will make me look less technical to my team"
**Core belief:** Asking an AI for help instead of figuring it out myself might signal that I'm not technical enough for this role.

**Why they're wrong:** The best PMMs are resourceful, not omniscient. Using Claude Code to get answers faster makes you more effective, not less credible. Engineers will appreciate fewer interruptions.

## Buying Process

### Awareness Stage
- Discovers Claude Code through LinkedIn, a product marketing Slack group, or a tweet from a peer
- Initial reaction: "Wait, this isn't just for engineers?"
- Clicks through to landing page to learn more

### Evaluation Stage
- Watches a demo or reads a use case for non-technical roles
- Key question: "Can I try this without installing a bunch of developer tools?"
- Looks for proof that other PMMs use it successfully

### Decision Stage
- Signs up for free trial (low friction, no credit card required)
- Tests it on a real task: "How does our authentication flow work?" or "Generate release notes from the last sprint"
- Decision criteria: Did this save me time? Was the output accurate? Would I use this again?

### Adoption Stage
- Integrates Claude Code into daily workflows: pre-launch research, content creation, technical Q&A
- Shares results with the team ("I used Claude Code to write these release notes in 10 minutes")
- Becomes an internal champion

## Marketing Implications

### Messaging Priorities
1. **Relevance for non-engineers** – Lead with "no coding required" and "ask questions in plain English"
2. **Time savings** – Emphasize speed and self-service over technical depth
3. **Quality and accuracy** – Address the fear that AI will produce generic or wrong answers
4. **Social proof** – Show other PMMs, PMs, and non-technical roles using it successfully

### Content Needs
- Use cases: "How PMMs use Claude Code to ship faster"
- Tutorial: "Your first 5 questions to ask Claude Code"
- Comparison: "Claude Code vs. ChatGPT for product marketers"
- ROI calculator: "How much time could you save per week?"

### Channels
- LinkedIn (primary): Organic posts, testimonials, carousel explainers
- Product marketing communities: Slack groups, Orbit, PMA
- Developer marketing blogs: Since this persona is adjacent to devtools
- Partnerships: Co-marketing with PM tools (Productboard, Linear) or content platforms (Notion, Gamma)

## Success Scenario (12 Months Post-Adoption)

Sarah is now the fastest PMM on her team. She uses Claude Code to:
- Answer technical questions independently (saving 5+ hours/week of eng time)
- Draft accurate release notes in 10 minutes instead of 2 hours
- Research competitors' APIs and feature sets without asking for help
- Write better product specs because she understands technical constraints upfront

She's become an internal advocate and convinced her VP of Marketing to buy a team license. Engineering loves her because she rarely interrupts them anymore. Sales loves her because competitive battlecards are always up-to-date.

Her LinkedIn bio now reads: "PMM who ships like an engineer (without being one)."
